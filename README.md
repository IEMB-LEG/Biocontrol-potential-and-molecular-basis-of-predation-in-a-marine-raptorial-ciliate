# Introduction

The file contains the secondary derived data and scripts of paper named "Biocontrol potential and molecular basis of predation in a marine raptorial ciliate".

# System Requirement and dependency

## Hardware Requirements

Glauconema phenotypic plasticity only requires a standard computer with sufficient RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For typical users, this would be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

  RAM: 8+ GB
  CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

## Software Requirements

R


# Usage

**Use the R script and the data in the folder to get the Figure.**

**Figure-1L**

# dataset
Here we provide the secondary derived data and scripts for Biocontrol potential and molecular basis of predation in a marine raptorial ciliate.

In the zip file, there are multiple folders named with the figure number, like predation_2026-Figure-1L, which contain the data and R scripts used to draw.
