# Introduction

The file contains the secondary derived data and scripts of paper named "Biocontrol potential and molecular basis of predation in a marine raptorial ciliate".

# System Requirement and dependency

## Hardware Requirements

Biocontrol potential and molecular basis of predation in a marine raptorial ciliat only requires a standard computer with sufficient RAM to support the operations defined by a user. For typical users, this would be a computer with about 2 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:

  RAM: 8+ GB
  CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core

## Software Requirements

R
